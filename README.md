Add to the project's summary down here:


Horizon_Immersive aims at exploring information in a new innovative, playful and interactive way, using immersive
3D environment on the web. 
The experience will sum up the EventHorizon conference which will be held at McGill on May 23rd-25th on the future of Universities. 

Our project constist of visually representing the core ideas that will be developed on the days of the conference. 
Those ideas will be represented as floating islands (or hubs) which offer their own characteristics, aesthetic and personal ways of conveying information.
Eg. The island of the technologies; the island of food; the island of discontent etc. 

Aesthetically, the team will explore the technics of photgrammetry and of 'classic' 3D modeling. 

User input is also crucial for this project: fellow students and academics interested in the subject should be able to weigh in
the debate and drop a comment that can be archived, read and shared. For that matter, two ideas emerged:
  - Creating an "User Island" where all comments can be viewed
  - Keeping track of the popularity of each ideas with a color coded system (the least visited island can go greyer over time let's say)
